# RULES
# Don't delete or modify the tasks, complete them in the empty spaces between.
# You can use anything (except asking others), but make sure you don't waste
# too much time on one task.
# If you don't understand a task, ask me.
# Don't worry about the results, if it goes badly, you just better understand
# what you have to learn more. End results will be more important :)
# We will go through these together afterwards.

# TASKS
# 1. Define a string variable called "dog" and assign it to some pet name


# 2. Do the same with variable "dog2". Then print out "dog just met dog2",
# but instead of "dog" and "dog2" insert the previously defined variables.


# 3. Define a boolean variable "i_am_enjoying_this_course" and give it a value
# of your choice


# 4. Create a statement that prints out "happy to hear that" if the
# previous variable "i_am_enjoying_this_course" is true
# (make it a one-liner for max points)


# 5. Create a variable "random_num" and set it to rand() * 10


# 6. Create a statement that prints out a word "big" if the previous defined
# number is bigger or equal than 5, and prints out word "small" in all other cases


# 7. Create a loop that prints out the value of variable "random_num" 10 times


# 8. What do you think is the result of the equation in the next line?
# true && (true || false)
# Define a variable "boolean1" and set it to the result of equation above


# 9. Another equation
# true && (true || false) && (!true && false && !false) || (true && !false)
# Define a variable "boolean2" and set it to the result of equation above
# (There's gotta be an easy way, right? Hint - use terminal)


# 10. Iterate through each element in the defined array "arr" and print out the value of
# element if it's an odd number
arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]


# (high difficulty)
# 11. Create a loop, that cycles 10 times.
# Inside this loop create a try/catch block.
# Inside "try" block do the following:
  # create a random number, exactly as in task number 5. Name it whatever you want.
  # raise exception if the number is bigger than 1
  # print out "very lucky!"
  # break the loop on the next line
# Inside "catch" block do the following:
  # print out "unlucky, lets try again"
